## Skill Acquisition

I haven't written on this subject for a while and I'm not sure if I will in the near future, but here are some quotes that resonate at the moment. I’ll probably pull in some from [[Reading/Do Hard Things|Do Hard Things]] in future as well.

Feel free to check out my [[Metrics/AimTrainingPerformance|AimTrainingPerformance]] notes!

>When you understand how simple attention can be used to learn any technical aspect of the game, with or without the aid of a technical instruction as a guide, it is quite an easy matter to discover the important places to focus your attention, and then use the same simple process of discovering from experience. — [[Reading/The Inner Game of Tennis|The Inner Game of Tennis]] location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Q5PFGK8&location=959) ^ref-29694

>All we need to do is try something and ask ourselves: “Is it more effective, requiring less effort?” If not, we try again. — [[Reading/Zen Body-Being|Zen Body-Being]] location: [2901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZOBVA&location=2901) ^ref-13632

>Relax, feel the whole body, find the center, become grounded, and be calm. — [[Reading/Zen Body-Being|Zen Body-Being]] location: [1486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZOBVA&location=1486) ^ref-14330

>Slow practice imprints your neural pathways with the same form that you will later use when moving at lightning speed. But at first you must make it slow to make sure it’s right. As your practice continues, the neural paths become stronger. But you’re not ready for fast moves yet. As your practice strengthens certain axon/dendrite patterns, you will notice that performing the movement requires less conscious supervision with respect to how you hold your arms or legs, the path that they travel, etc. The technique seems to flow, and your execution acquires a smooth quality. Now you are ready to increase your speed. Don’t try for blurring speed all at once, though. When you first notice how smooth and effortless your technique has become, you’ll be tempted to pour on the speed. Okay, go ahead and try a few reps, but then go back to your slo-mo speed and gradually increase the pace. Otherwise, jumping to warp speed may result in allowing sloppiness to creep in. — [[Reading/Slow Practice Will Get You There Faster|Slow Practice Will Get You There Faster]] location: [936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Q1651LT&location=936) ^ref-3291
