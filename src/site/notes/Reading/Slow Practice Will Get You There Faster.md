## Highlights
“Slow practice imprints your neural pathways with the same form that you will later use when moving at lightning speed. But at first you must make it slow to make sure it’s right. As your practice continues, the neural paths become stronger. But you’re not ready for fast moves yet. As your practice strengthens certain axon/dendrite patterns, you will notice that performing the movement requires less conscious supervision with respect to how you hold your arms or legs, the path that they travel, etc. The technique seems to flow, and your execution acquires a smooth quality. Now you are ready to increase your speed. Don’t try for blurring speed all at once, though. When you first notice how smooth and effortless your technique has become, you’ll be tempted to pour on the speed. Okay, go ahead and try a few reps, but then go back to your slo-mo speed and gradually increase the pace. Otherwise, jumping to warp speed may result in allowing sloppiness to creep in. — location: [936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Q1651LT&location=936) ^ref-3291
