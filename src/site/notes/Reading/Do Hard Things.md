## Highlights
In other words, soldiers were training their biology and psychology to work in tandem during challenging moments. It’s not that they weren’t experiencing discomfort; instead, they had figured out ways to maintain clarity when everything around them was pushing them toward chaos. High performers are able to work their way through adversity and challenge with the same equanimity. When put in situations that require toughness, it’s not that they are bulldozing through the experiences; they navigate them with grit and grace. — location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=487) ^ref-47380

---
Sometimes our inner world screams at us to quit; sometimes it nudges us toward apathy and complacency. Jonathan Wai, a prolific academic at the University of Arkansas who studies gifted education, described to me how he often loses this inner battle: “I find myself staring off into space, avoiding writing and revising various papers and projects. . . . I often side with the lower-hanging fruit.” We all face similar pulls, and understanding this process is central to navigating it. — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=498) ^ref-29472

---
Toughness is about making the pull for closure amid uncertainty work with you, not against you. It’s training the mind to handle uncertainty long enough so that you can nudge or guide your response in the right direction. To create space so that you don’t jump straight from unease to the quickest possible solution, but to the “correct” one. — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=535) ^ref-21634

---
Toughness is about embracing the reality of where we are and what we have to do. Not deluding ourselves, filling ourselves with a false confidence, or living in denial. All of that simply sends us sprinting off the line, only to slow to a walk once reality hits. Being tough begins long before we enter the arena or walk on stage. It starts with our expectations. — location: [577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=577) ^ref-4968

---
If there’s a large mismatch between expectations and reality, our brain overcorrects. If we went into a test thinking it would be a cakewalk, at the first sign of difficulty, it’s as if the brain goes, “Hey! What is this? This isn’t supposed to be hard!” As a result, instead of figuring a way through the discomfort, we shut down. We go into full protective mode. We freeze. — location: [659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=659) ^ref-43643

---
Our appraisal of a situation as a threat or as a challenge depends on the perceived demands of that stressor versus our perceived abilities to handle them. Do we have the resources to handle the demands? — location: [669](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=669) ^ref-44696

Embrace reality. Accurate appraisal of demands + accurate appraisal of our abilities. — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=716) ^ref-1899

1. Set Appropriate Goals We’re often told to shoot for the moon or dream big when it comes to setting goals, but research points to the opposite conclusion: set goals that are just beyond our current capabilities. If there’s too large of a mismatch between our abilities and our goal, our motivation decreases. — location: [723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=723) ^ref-31839

---
Whether through introspection, journaling, or conversations with close friends and family, do the hard work to ask what matters and why it does. — location: [735](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=735) ^ref-64681

---
What happens when we set an audacious goal and quickly realize we can’t hit it? When we don’t think we have a shot, whether it’s in a race or in class, our brain shuts us down. Our mind jumps into protection mode, thinking, “Well, we aren’t going to win, so why waste any energy trying?” We are unintentionally killing our drive if we define success and failure in such a narrow way. — location: [738](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=738) ^ref-14487

---
Shifting the focus toward process-oriented goals, such as the effort you can put forth, helps remedy these situations. It also provides vital feedback that allows you to grow in the future. — location: [743](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=743) ^ref-14909

---
Judging yourself by how much effort you gave or whether you executed your plan offers a road map for what can be worked on during the next go-round. — location: [746](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=746) ^ref-37730

---
When we flip into a threat state, a freeze reaction, or a full-blown freak-out, the normal often seems unattainable. We tend to overcompensate, greatly diminishing what we’re capable of. Part of having an accurate appraisal is course-correcting. If you feel tired, fatigued, or anxious, you can learn how to navigate that. — location: [761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=761) ^ref-7437

---
Stress shifts us toward a negative bias, priming us to search out and recognize danger or threats in the environment. This is a great evolutionary survival mechanism, but it can hamper our performance when we aren’t really in danger. To combat this quirk of evolution, prime your mind to search for opportunities, not threats. In Peak Performance, I outlined research that shows that when athletes warm up by “doing what they like,” they alter their hormonal state in a positive manner. The same phenomenon applies to artists and executives. The closer you are to a performance, the more you want to prime with what you’re good at. Reviewing mistakes, working on weaknesses, telling yourself that you “can’t hit the slider, so watch for it” backfires when you’re on deck. Those are items you work on far before it’s time to step into the batter’s box. — location: [771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=771) ^ref-46600

---
As discomfort and doubt rise, the “devil on our shoulder” part of our mind goes on high alert, looking for evidence that backs up its view—anything that it can use to justify quitting or putting in less effort. When confidence is low, we are priming our minds to be susceptible to the negative spiral. We already have doubts over our ability to perform up to our expectations, so at the first sign of that being the case, our brain grasps hold of it. A gentle nudge and we’re headed toward a full-blown freak-out. — location: [850](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=850) ^ref-60031

---
push comes to shove, this external variety fails. True confidence has to be founded in reality, and it comes from the inside. It’s not in ignoring the human condition of experiencing doubt and insecurity, but coming to terms with them and what you’re capable of. It’s not in the elimination of doubt, but in allowing enough doubt to keep us in check, while being secure in the knowledge that we’ll find a way past the obstacle in our way. — location: [868](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=868) ^ref-28926

---
Confidence is a filter, tinting how we see the challenges before us and our ability to handle them. — location: [878](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=878) ^ref-40952

---
Successful people tend to have higher self-esteem not because they are striving for self-worth itself, but because it’s a by-product of overcoming challenges and making meaningful connections with others. Our inner narrative changes when we are challenged and overcome adversity. When we put forth effort on a difficult task, we internalize that we have a strong work ethic. We become adept at knowing that we, too, can “grind away” at a problem. Lasting self-esteem doesn’t come from being told that we are great. It comes from doing the actual work and making real connections. — location: [940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=940) ^ref-61508

---
With the self-esteem movement, we flipped the script, trying to give self-esteem without the accompanying action and work to validate it. Even worse, we shifted the focus away from the joy of actually doing the work and toward external praise and rewards. — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=945) ^ref-20769

---
Those who scored high in a particular type of extrinsic motivation called external regulation had lower improvement rates. External regulation is defined as when “the sport is performed not for fun but to obtain rewards (e.g., praise) or to avoid negative consequences (e.g., criticisms from parents).” The five highest-ranked athletes in external regulation were five athletes who showed the least amount of improvement. — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=966) ^ref-23414

---
When it came to self-esteem, we tried to boost a generation with methods that pushed us toward having the contingent and externally driven kind. When self-esteem is contingent, it’s fragile. When it’s based on external rewards or praise, it’s dependent on something over which we have little control. When it comes to developing confidence, we often fall to the same fate. We attempt to create a fragile sense of confidence, one based on bravado and external displays. We try to prop up our confidence levels with praise, rewards, and even grade inflation, which often is unearned or undeserved. We believe that failure of any kind should be avoided instead of embraced, because it shatters our confidence. — location: [970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=970) ^ref-18561

---
When we face a challenge, expectation and reality should have a high degree of overlap. Whenever they do not (i.e., a high sense of confidence and low ability to meet the task’s demands, or vice versa), then our likelihood to persist through a challenge or even perform at our best is greatly diminished. We’re more likely to choose the easy way out. To stop. To quit. To find a solution that doesn’t involve confronting whatever is in our way. — location: [1003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1003) ^ref-18911

---
It’s easy to feel confident in the beginning but when we come face-to-face with the reality that we might fall short of our goal, we experience what psychologists call an action crisis. We shift from a goal-directed orientation, where the motivation to achieve is the focus, to a state where negative thoughts and sensations persist. We shift from being driven to succeed to negotiating with ourself to abandon the goal. — location: [1010](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1010) ^ref-33575

---
If we artificially elevate our confidence, telling ourselves this will be a piece of cake or we’ve got this in the bag, our brain is constantly receiving the message that we won’t have to work hard to achieve our goal. If it’s supposed to be easy, why should we waste excess resources? When reality hits us, we jump straight to a freak-out. “What’s happening?! I thought this was going to be easy or within our capabilities,” our mind might think. Cultivating fake confidence creates insecurity for our minds to exploit. — location: [1025](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1025) ^ref-47667

---
When trying to improve, most of us go for the lift-the-ceiling approach, judging ourselves by our best performance ever. In track, we would define ourselves by our personal best for an event. To get better meant running faster than we ever had before. Brian Barraza, a professional runner, sees performance in a different light. “My goal is to raise the floor. Being confident in that whenever I step out on the track, I’m going to be able to run a certain time.” Instead of going all in for the massive breakthrough, Barraza sets a minimum expectation. “When you raise the floor, it allows for those days when everything is clicking to exceed expectations. It’s not that we are lowering our ceiling or playing it safe; it’s that we’ve developed the confidence to know that X performance is repeatable. That as long as we do what’s in our control, we can achieve a certain standard, no matter the circumstances,” Barraza told me one day after practice. As I watched this idea percolate through the athletes, I came to notice a trend. Those who raised their floors had an inner confidence about them. What once seemed crazy to contemplate was now the norm. — location: [1049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1049) ^ref-42338

---
Don’t lower your expectations just so you can become confident. Understand what you are capable of, and set a standard that falls within that realm or just a touch outside of it. — location: [1060](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1060) ^ref-40711

“If you have doubt or concern about a shot, or feel the ‘pressure’ of that shot, it’s because you haven’t practiced it enough. The only way to relieve that pressure is to build your fundamentals, practice them over and over, so when the game breaks down, you can handle anything that transpires.” — location: [1101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1101) ^ref-65032

We lose the ability to try. Lack of control extinguishes the flame of even the most motivated. When we lack control, when we feel like no matter what we do, it doesn’t make any difference, our brain is getting the message “What’s the point?” — location: [1177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1177) ^ref-57092

Leach believes that bringing some sort of normalcy to perilous situations “requires an appraisal that the person has, at least, some control over his situation, has not accepted mental defeat.” He goes on to conclude, “That sensation of choice indicates a reversal of mental defeat and the reimposition of some personal control over the situation which is a key factor in recovery. . . . [Give-up-itis] is the clinical expression of mental defeat; in particular, it is a pathology of a normal, passive coping response.” — location: [1225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1225) ^ref-37041

---
When we feel like we have no say or choice, we’re on the path toward listlessness. We are the dogs who learned that no matter how many times we press the button for help, no one is coming. It’s no wonder difficult decisions now seem overwhelming. Or why many of us struggle to get out the door to exercise, or even do the dishes at night. We blame it on lack of will, or motivation, but the truth is when we lack a sense of control over our life, apathy naturally takes over. — location: [1234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1234) ^ref-732

---
When we lack control, our stress spikes. When we have a sense that we can impact the situation, our cortisol response is dampened. Control doesn’t alter just our hormonal response but also the experience that accompanies stress. When researchers peered into the brains of subjects with fMRI machines, they found that when pain was controllable, participants had lower rates of anxiety, along with a decreased response in the threat-sensing area of the brain (amygdala). They had not only a lower alarm response from the amygdala, but also a better-equipped controller (the prefrontal cortex) that was able to step in and put out the fire much more quickly. When we have a sense of control, our alarm is quieter and easier to shut off. — location: [1262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1262) ^ref-25654

---
Control alters not only our physiological response to stress, but also our ability to persist. When we believe we have influence over an outcome, we’re more likely to persevere, even if we face a setback. — location: [1268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1268) ^ref-53224

Our level of control changes how we respond to stress. When we have a sense of control, our alarm is quieter and easier to shut off. — location: [1288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1288) ^ref-37875

---
When life feels like it’s spinning out of control, or like the task you have in front of you is insurmountable, it’s easy to default to hopelessness. To “What’s the point?” That’s natural. Your body evolved to conserve energy. We need to train hopefulness. To clear the path to continue. It doesn’t take big heroic efforts to train hope. Small signals that you are in control, that you can have an impact, will be enough to turn our prefrontal cortex back on. — location: [1325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1325) ^ref-35382

---
In a review on the subject for Trends in Cognitive Sciences, researchers Lauren Leotti, Sheena Iyengar, and Kevin Ochsner hammer home the importance of the need for control. In their conclusion, they state, “The evidence suggests the desire to exercise control, and thus, the desire to make choices, is paramount for survival.” They go on to summarize their findings: “The desire for control is not something we acquire through learning, but rather, is innate, and thus likely biologically motivated. We are born to choose.” We have a basic underlying need to have some semblance of control over whatever we’re tackling. Constraining and controlling workplaces take that away, nudging us toward quitting at the first sign of discomfort. Autonomy is the switch that allows us to persist. — location: [1341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1341) ^ref-45959

---
By putting the athletes in a position to choose—whether to speed up, slow down, lift another rep, or call it a day—we can take advantage of the power of choice. When we put people in a position to choose, we can “switch on” and train their prefrontal cortex, allowing them to understand and regulate the sensations of pain, fatigue, and anxiety that often come with such difficult moments. We allow them to try, adjust, perhaps even fail, but above all, learn. — location: [1397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1397) ^ref-19105

---
The key to improving mental toughness does not lie in constraining and controlling individuals. It doesn’t lie in developing harsh punishments to teach them a lesson. It doesn’t lie in screaming at a person to complete whatever demanding task is in front of them. When we don’t have control, we lose the capacity to cope. It’s when we have a choice that toughness is trained. Our brain literally turns on, figuring out how to work our way through the situation at hand. We were born to choose, so let us learn how to do it. — location: [1405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1405) ^ref-10974

When we don’t have control, we lose the capacity to cope. It’s when we have a choice that toughness is trained. — location: [1410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1410) ^ref-14171

Leading Yourself In the four exercises that follow, I’ve outlined how to develop that sense of control in yourself. 1. From Small to Large Take a difficult situation that brings about discomfort; maybe it’s performance-related anxiety or a conversation that you are dreading. What we often do is try to control “the thing.” So if anxiety is the issue, we try to attack the nerves and fear. We try to force ourselves to turn down the tension, and then after that doesn’t work, our brain comes to the logical conclusion that we have no control over our body or the situation. “I can’t control my anxiety, so why try?” Instead of wrestling the giant monster, start with the smallest item that you can have control over that’s related to the problem. Is it your breath? Can you intentionally slow your breathing down? Or maybe it’s something as simple as showing up on time or getting through the first mile of your marathon. Break it down to something manageable and feasible. The goal isn’t to stop there but to get a foothold so that you can gradually climb to the next level. Once you have a sense of control over the smallest item, then move to something slightly larger. Move from small to large. 2. Give Yourself a Choice Without knowing it, we often box ourselves into a corner, taking any semblance of choice away. We feel trapped, pushed to persist no matter what. Whenever we don’t have a choice, we aren’t training toughness. If, for example, you say that I have to complete this task by 3 p.m., that might work when completing a manageable task. But when you face something beyond your reach, you’re more likely to throw in the towel and say “This is impossible,” instead of persisting. We’re often told that when creating a habit, like going to the gym, we need to be rigid and specific. Show up every day at 7 a.m. to work out, and never miss a day. But what research shows is having choice, such as “I’m allowed to miss two days per week if I have to,” results in a longer-lasting, more sustainable habit. Katy Milkman, behavioral scientist and author of How to Change, calls this allowing for a mulligan. It’s why research shows in dieting that cheat days actually help. All or nothing often leaves you with nothing. Giving yourself a choice sometimes means entertaining the idea of quitting, slowing down, or even giving up. It’s not that I want you to do so, but by having a choice,… — location: [1415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1415) ^ref-746

---
When we don’t feel in control, our emotions and inner voice spiral. Tasks feel harder, the pain feels more intense, and our doubts seem louder. Our motivation plummets as we head toward apathy and a lack of will to act. It’s nearly impossible to be tough when there’s no hope of navigating your way through the current situation. It’s as if we shrug our shoulders and say, “What’s the point?” Being tough is about navigating this experience so that we can keep moving forward. Toughness isn’t just about persistence in the face of discomfort. It’s about making a good decision. — location: [1513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1513) ^ref-21078

---
We often equate toughness with persistence, but in some cases, it’s the exact opposite. Toughness is navigating the inner turmoil in order to make a good decision. Sometimes that’s to persist. Other times it’s to quit. — location: [1522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1522) ^ref-13484

---
Choice allows us to take back control, to be able to make that decision. It’s a kind of superpower that brings back confidence, helps us wrestle with our emotions, and allows us to learn, adapt, and grow. So much so that people report that even if the choice they are given during a task is completely meaningless and inconsequential, that demanding task feels a bit more enjoyable, a bit more manageable. If we want to develop tough individuals, we’ve got to put them in a position to make decisions, and empower them to do just that. — location: [1523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1523) ^ref-55154

---
Emotions, on the other hand, are more complex. They require context and meaning. To go from simple displeasure to sadness, we need to know what sadness entails. We combine a raw sensation (pleasure) with what else is going on in our internal and external world, add in a dash of experience, and all of a sudden, we feel our version of the emotion love. — location: [1563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1563) ^ref-12810

---
The “power through” mantra makes sense only if you actually take stock of what you are powering through. That is what the old definition of grit got wrong. Feelings are signals that need to be understood. Pain isn’t something to fear or push our way through; it’s a message that needs interpretation. One that sometimes needs heeding, and other times can be allowed to pass by. And if we mistake a challenge for danger or nerves for a full-blown anxiety attack, it doesn’t matter how “tough” we are; we are headed straight toward a “freak-out.” The first step to toughness is training your body and mind to understand and interpret the signals you are receiving. — location: [1663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1663) ^ref-63098

TOUGHNESS MAXIM Feelings are subject to distortion. They depend on context and interpretation. The better we’re able to interpret, the better our ultimate decision. — location: [1668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1668) ^ref-37704

Accompanying any difficult situation is a cacophony of feelings and emotions. Understanding their role as messengers and pushers allows you to find clarity instead of being overwhelmed with confusion. — location: [1717](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1717) ^ref-26550

If we continually misread the signals that our body is sending, our brains’ predictions on what’s coming will also be flawed. — location: [1767](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1767) ^ref-62857

---
When we lose the capacity to distinguish the nuance of the experience, we jump straight to the easy decision. Part of being tough is fine-tuning your ability to experience and decipher what you’re feeling. Better interoceptive skills are correlated with better emotional functioning and linked to lower levels of depression. — location: [1772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1772) ^ref-37043

---
Tough individuals develop the ability to discern the nuance that most of us are blind to. Thankfully, this is a skill that can be developed. — location: [1776](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1776) ^ref-38959

---
The first step toward developing nuance involves going deep into the experience. If we direct our attention toward an emotion or sensation, examining the feedback for long enough, we can start to distinguish shades of gray where there was once a single category. Go toward the discomfort, deliberately focusing your attention, so that you can peel back the layers. — location: [1779](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1779) ^ref-7136

---
When we label emotions or experiences, we can change not only our interpretation of them, but also how our body responds. When researchers out of UCLA had participants label what they were feeling before giving a speech, they dampened down their brain’s alarm (amygdala) and turned on the brain’s controller (PFC). The more granular their descriptions, the better they were able to handle the swirl of emotions that accompanied the public speaking. — location: [1784](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1784) ^ref-19462

Exercise 1: Go Deep to Understand Nuance 1. Get specific. In this exercise, you want to experience feelings that are closely related to the situation you are working on. For example, for the pain of an athletic competition, hop on an exercise bike and do a hard workout or sit in an ice bath and feel a similar kind of pain. For anxiety, if it’s social, put yourself in an uncomfortable social situation. Or stand on the balcony at a hotel if heights give you that same feeling. Always make sure you are taking safety into account. 2. Go into the feelings and sensations. Direct your attention right at what you’re experiencing or feeling and sit with that sensation. The goal is to experience without judging. Our aim is to collect experiences. Not necessarily to do anything about them, just to begin the process of unraveling what “pain” or “anxiety” means in different contexts. — location: [1801](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1801) ^ref-12646

---
Exercise 2: Name It 1. Develop a vocabulary. When a first grader is asked to describe a person, they stick with basic adjectives: pretty, smart, nice. As they expand their vocabulary, they can describe people and objects more effectively. When it comes to emotions and feelings, most of us act like kindergartners. Expanding our vocabulary allows us to find nuance and clarity. 2. Describe the feeling. When describing what you’re feeling, get creative and try to describe it in as many ways as possible. For example, pain is nebulous. Is it burning, dull, transient, or constant? The same goes for stress or anxiety. Use tools like the emotion wheel, or search for synonyms that may better describe the experience. When describing our inner experience, first go for breadth, then depth. 3. Separate the feeling from the physiology. While describing, try to separate the physical sensations from the feeling. For example, sweaty palms and a racing heart are the physical sensations. The anxiety or fear that we often intertwine is separate. 4. Name it. Emotions develop based on context. Find the nuance between the different signals. The nerves you feel before giving a talk? Call that your performance adrenaline. When we name something, we exert power and control over it. We are saying, “I know what you are and how to handle you.” 5. Reappraise it. Reframe the signal as helpful information. Can you see anxiety, fear, pain, and sadness as signals conveying a message? Now that you understand the nuance of feelings and emotions and have a name for what you’re experiencing, take control of the message. Can you see anxiety as excitement? The fear you experience is a reminder that caution has value. The sadness after a loss is a reminder to cherish and reconnect with those you still have with you.
