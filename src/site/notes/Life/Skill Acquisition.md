## Skill Acquisition

I haven't written on this subject for a while and I'm not sure if I will in the near future, but here are some quotes that resonate at the moment. I’ll probably pull in some more from [[Reading/Do Hard Things|Do Hard Things]] in future as well.

> When trying to improve, most of us go for the lift-the-ceiling approach, judging ourselves by our best performance ever. In track, we would define ourselves by our personal best for an event. To get better meant running faster than we ever had before. Brian Barraza, a professional runner, sees performance in a different light. “My goal is to raise the floor. Being confident in that whenever I step out on the track, I’m going to be able to run a certain time.” Instead of going all in for the massive breakthrough, Barraza sets a minimum expectation. “When you raise the floor, it allows for those days when everything is clicking to exceed expectations. It’s not that we are lowering our ceiling or playing it safe; it’s that we’ve developed the confidence to know that X performance is repeatable. That as long as we do what’s in our control, we can achieve a certain standard, no matter the circumstances,” Barraza told me one day after practice. As I watched this idea percolate through the athletes, I came to notice a trend. Those who raised their floors had an inner confidence about them. What once seemed crazy to contemplate was now the norm. — [[Reading/Do Hard Things|Do Hard Things]] location: [1049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09GRDXXCP&location=1049) ^ref-42338

>When you understand how simple attention can be used to learn any technical aspect of the game, with or without the aid of a technical instruction as a guide, it is quite an easy matter to discover the important places to focus your attention, and then use the same simple process of discovering from experience. — [[Reading/The Inner Game of Tennis|The Inner Game of Tennis]] location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Q5PFGK8&location=959) ^ref-29694

>All we need to do is try something and ask ourselves: “Is it more effective, requiring less effort?” If not, we try again. — [[Reading/Zen Body-Being|Zen Body-Being]] location: [2901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZOBVA&location=2901) ^ref-13632

>Relax, feel the whole body, find the center, become grounded, and be calm. — [[Reading/Zen Body-Being|Zen Body-Being]] location: [1486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZOBVA&location=1486) ^ref-14330

>Slow practice imprints your neural pathways with the same form that you will later use when moving at lightning speed. But at first you must make it slow to make sure it’s right. As your practice continues, the neural paths become stronger. But you’re not ready for fast moves yet. As your practice strengthens certain axon/dendrite patterns, you will notice that performing the movement requires less conscious supervision with respect to how you hold your arms or legs, the path that they travel, etc. The technique seems to flow, and your execution acquires a smooth quality. Now you are ready to increase your speed. Don’t try for blurring speed all at once, though. When you first notice how smooth and effortless your technique has become, you’ll be tempted to pour on the speed. Okay, go ahead and try a few reps, but then go back to your slo-mo speed and gradually increase the pace. Otherwise, jumping to warp speed may result in allowing sloppiness to creep in. — [[Reading/Slow Practice Will Get You There Faster|Slow Practice Will Get You There Faster]] location: [936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Q1651LT&location=936) ^ref-3291
